# SlackBot

The purpose of this slackBot is to receive questions that the Blue Movement members may have and store them inside of a priority queue. Once in the queue, A Blue Movement staff member will then be notified to answer the question. This not only allows the student to pay attention during sessions rather than holding a question, but also gives the staff memeber time to give a more detailed/in-depth answer.
